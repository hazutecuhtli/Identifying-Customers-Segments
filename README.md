## Project Introduction

Welcome to the project for this part of the Nanodegree program. Now that you’ve learned about unsupervised learning techniques that allow you to summarize the dimensions of your data and cluster unlabeled data into groups with similar properties, it’s time to apply your knowledge to some real-life data.

In this project, our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. You’ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
